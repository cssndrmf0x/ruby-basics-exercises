# fave_num.rb

# The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with the 
# number following it by placing the pair in their own array. Then create a nested
# array containing all three groups. What does this look like? (You don't need to
# write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it meets the exercise 
# requirements.)

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]

# Flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result should not have any 
# subarrays, but should have all of the original strings and numbers from the 
# original array

p favorites.flatten!
